# Physics Informed Neural Networks(PINNs)
Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is a machine learning technique that incorporates physical laws and constraints into the neural network training process for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in various fields of science and engineering, including solid mechanics. 

In this repository PINN model that integrated the Timoshenko equation to predict the deflection of the beam at any distance and time and compared the results with those obtained through the
traditional finite element method.
